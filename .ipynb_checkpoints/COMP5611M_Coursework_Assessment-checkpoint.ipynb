    "\n",
    "The provided dataset comprises data collected from multiple counties in the US. The regression task for this assessment is to predict cancer mortality rates in \"unseen\" US counties, given some training data. The training data ('Training_data.csv') comprises various features/predictors related to socio-economic characteristics, amongst other types of information for specific counties in the country. The corresponding target variables for the training set are provided in a separate CSV file ('Training_data_targets.csv'). Use the notebooks provided for lab sessions throughout this module to provide solutions to the exercises listed below. Throughout all exercises text describing your code and answering any questions included in the exercise descriptions should be included as part of your submitted solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - We also provide an example test data set ('Test_data_example.csv' and 'Test_data_example_targets.csv'). This is just an example of the final test set (which will NOT be provided to you) that will be used to evaluate your solutions when your submitted solutions are being marked. The provided Test data (I.e. 'Test_data_example.csv' and 'Test_data_example_targets.csv') is NOT to be used as an independent test set when developing your models, but only to prepare your 'prediction/inference' script to make predictions on completely unseen data. Part of this assessment requires you to write such an inference script that evaluates your best, trained regression model on the final test data set such that, we are able to run the inference script ourselves on the unseen (i.e. data we have not provided to you) test data. Yyou can use the example test data ('Test_data_example.csv' and 'Test_data_example_targets.csv') to verify that it works prior to submission.\n",
